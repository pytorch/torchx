Intro KubeFlow Pipelines Example
================================

This an introductory pipeline using KubeFlow Pipelines built with only TorchX
components.

TorchX is intended to allow making cross platform components. As such, we have
a standard definition that uses adapters to convert it to the specific
pipeline platform. This is an example of using the KFP adapter to run a TorchX
component as part of a KubeFlow Pipeline.

TorchX tries to leverage standard mechanisms wherever possible. For KFP we use
the existing KFP pipeline definition syntax and add a single
`component_from_app` conversion step to convert a TorchX component into one
KFP can understand.

Typically you have a separate component file but for this example we define the
AppDef inline.

        # First we define our AppDef for the component. AppDef is a core part of TorchX
        # and can be used to describe complex distributed multi container apps or
        # just a single node component like here.
        echo_app: specs.AppDef = specs.AppDef(
            name="examples-intro",
            roles=[
                specs.Role(
                    name="worker",

            ],
        )

        # To convert the TorchX AppDef into a KFP container we use
        # the container_from_app adapter. This takes generates a KFP component
        # definition from the TorchX app def and instantiates it into a container.
        echo_container: kfp.dsl.ContainerOp = container_from_app(echo_app)

To generate the pipeline definition file we need to call into the KFP compiler
with our pipeline function.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 59-68

.. code-block:: default


    kfp.compiler.Compiler().compile(
        pipeline_func=pipeline,
        package_path="pipeline.yaml",
    )

    with open("pipeline.yaml", "rt") as f:
        print(f.read())


.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 69-76

Once this has all run you should have a pipeline file (typically
pipeline.yaml) that you can upload to your KFP cluster via the UI or
a kfp.Client.

See the
`KFP SDK Examples <https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/tutorials/sdk-examples/#examples>`_
for more info on launching KFP pipelines.

See the :ref:`examples_pipelines/kfp/advanced_pipeline:Advanced KubeFlow Pipelines Example` for how to chain multiple
components together and use builtin components.
