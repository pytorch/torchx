"""
The ``torchx.runtime`` module contains libraries and utilities that you can
use while authoring your applications. The usage of this module is not a hard
requirement to use TorchX, but it will make it easier for you to author
applications that are scheduler and infrastructure agnostic.


The sub-modules of ``torchx.runtime`` are categorized by topic. For example in
the ``torchx.runtime.hpo`` module you will find libraries that are useful
when authoring hyper-parameter optimization jobs (applications).
