"""
For metrics we recommend using Tensorboard to log metrics directly to cloud
storage along side your model. As the model trains you can launch a
tensorboard instance locally to monitor your model progress:

.. code-block:: shell-session

 $ tensorboard --log-dir provider://path/to/logs

Or you can use the :py:meth:`torchx.components.metrics.tensorboard` component as
part of your pipeline.

See the :ref:`examples_apps/lightning_classy_vision/train:Trainer Example` for an example on how to use the PyTorch
Lightning TensorboardLogger.

    This component runs a Tensorboard server which will render the logs
    specified by logdir.

    Since Tensorboard runs as a service you need to specify the termination
    conditions. This consists of a timeout as well as an optional
    ``exit_on_file`` which will cause the service to quit when that path is
    created.

    The files are periodically polled for existence via fsspec and will trigger
    the corresponding behavior when created.

        image: image to use
        timeout: maximum time to run before exiting (seconds)
