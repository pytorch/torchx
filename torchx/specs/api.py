    Available macros:

    1. ``img_root`` - root directory of the pulled container.image
    2. ``app_id`` - application id as assigned by the scheduler
    3. ``replica_id`` - unique id for each instance of a replica of a Role,

                        as replica ids. Note that when the container fails and is

        Parses scheduler ``cfg`` from a string literal and returns
        a cfg map where the cfg values have been cast into the appropriate
        types as specified by this runopts object. Unknown keys are ignored
        and not returned in the resulting map.

        .. note:: Unlike the method ``resolve``, this method does NOT resolve
                  default options or check that the required options are actually
                  present in the given ``cfg_str``. This method is intended to be
                  called before calling ``resolve()`` when the input is a string
                  encoded run cfg. That is to fully resolve the cfg, call
                  ``opt.resolve(opt.cfg_from_str(cfg_literal))``.

        If the ``cfg_str`` is an empty string, then an empty
        ``cfg`` is returned. Otherwise, at least one kv-pair delimited by
        ``"="`` (equal) is expected.

        Either ``","`` (comma) or ``";"`` (semi-colon)
        can be used to delimit multiple kv-pairs.

        ``CfgVal`` allows ``List`` of primitives, which can be passed as
        either ``","`` or ``";"`` (semi-colon) delimited. Since the same
        delimiters are used to delimit between cfg kv pairs, this method
        interprets the last (trailing) ``","`` or ``";"`` as the delimiter between
        kv pairs. See example below.

    Parses the app handle into ```(scheduler_backend, session_name, and app_id)```.

    Example:

    .. doctest::

     assert parse_app_handle("k8s://default/foo_bar") == ("k8s", "default", "foo_bar")
     assert parse_app_handle("k8s:///foo_bar") == ("k8s", "", "foo_bar")

    Args:
        app_handle: a URI of the form ``{scheduler}://{session_name}/{app_id}``,
            where the ``session_name`` is optional. In this case the app handle is
            of the form ``{scheduler}:///{app_id}`` (notice the triple slashes).

    Returns: A ``Tuple`` of three elements, ``(scheduler, session_name, app_id)``
        parsed from the app_handle URI str. If the session name is not present then
        an empty string is returned in its place in the tuple.
