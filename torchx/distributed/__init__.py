    A convenience wrapper around ``torch.distributed.init_proces_group()``
    that makes initializing a trivial (single world_size) process group easy.

    Useful when you want to make your code portable across launching with
    simple python or with ``torchrun`` (aka ``torch.distributed.run``)

    .. doctest::

     >>> from torchx.distributed import init_pg
     >>> init_pg(backend="gloo") # or nccl # doctest: +SKIP
     device(type='cpu')

    The example above works to initialize a pytorch process group
    for the trivial (``world_size = 1``) and distributed (``world_size > 1``)
    cases without you having to write an explicit check with an if-else branch statement.

    You can pass ``backend="auto"`` to have this function select ``"nccl"``

      >>> from torchx.distributed import init_pg

    This is useful in situations there a node-local action (that would otherwise cause races)
    needs to be done first from a representative worker on each node. For instance,
    downloading a checkpoint file to a tmp dir on each node once, then having all the
    workers read off the downloaded file.
